# Opt_GraphColoring

## Story:

While studying on coursera online course "Discrete Optimization" with Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck we implemented solved many different general constrained optimization problems. On of them, most simple was Graph Coloring.

## Results:

## Todo:

- [ ] when graph is dense try to consider reverse graph. some sets. minimum bounds
- [ ] make more optimized graph structures. look something with feasible tabu search
- [ ] donâ€™t look on colored graph pointing out uncolored nodes.
