# GraphColoring

Here we can work in feasible and infeasible solution spaces. Infeasible solution space includes notion of uncolored node or color violations.

Relaxation of the problem also gives us new objective functions:
* reduce amount of uncolored nodes
* reduce some of the color classes to zero while expanding others
* reduce amount of violations
